We translate neurobiological principles of sensory computing into event-based algorithms for data processing, inference and control. 

We accelerate those algorithms using _Neuromorphic Systems_: brain-inspired computer architectures that accelerate event-based computation. 

We evaluate the performance of those systems and algorithms in robotic AI tasks such as neuromorphic olfaction and gas-based navigation.
