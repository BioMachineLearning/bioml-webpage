## Projects

#### Event-based olfaction

We develop novel apporaches to machine olfaction that leverage the event-based sampling paradigm, and algorithms to for gas detection and identification. We combine principles of olfactory processing in the brain with research into gas dispersion in turbulent environments to design new algorithms and devices for gas detection, identification, and gas-based robotic navigation.

#### Neuromorphic computing 

Neuromorphic hardware is a new kind of brain-inspired computing hardware that involves a massively parallel, event-based approach to computing. We design algorithms for sensing, inference and control on neuromorphic hardware platforms.

#### Chemical space of odorants

Fragrance and aroma are an essential part of everyday life. Yet, the relationship between the chemical structure of odorants and their percepts remain largely elusive. We use machine learning to mine the chemical space of odorants in order to uncover structure-activity relationships for odorants and their receptors.

#### Data science and analytics for neuroscience

We collaborate with leading neuroscience labs to stay on the forefront of discovery in olfaction and brain-like computing. Sometimes we can contribute our expertise in data science and machine learning and help extract knowledge from challenging datasets.
