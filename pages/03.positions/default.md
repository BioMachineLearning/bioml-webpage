# Vice Chancellors Research Fellow in Neuromorphic Computing

The Vice-Chancellorâ€™s Research Fellow (VCRF) is a prestigious position that provides outstanding candidates with the opportunity to shape their field of research and build a career in research.

The VCRF in Neuromorphic Computing will be embedded in a leading team of researchers who advance computational olfactory neuroscience. Our research activities include mapping the chemical space of odorants, electronic gas sensing, and robotic gas-based navigation. The successful candidate will therefore have the unique opportunity to develop an internationally leading research agenda in this field.
